What is OOP Programming in Java
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data,
or objects, rather than functions and logic.

Prevention of code repeatition, security, efficiency, less complexity

Object
Everything that exists in the real world is an object.
And also an object is an instance of a class that models a real-world object.
One class may produce several objects as an example:-
from a house blueprint, we can build several houses similar but location and name are different.
-----
Class - Classification > category, department, section, wing, division, compartmentation,
senf
-----
Class > Object
Vehicle > (Car, Motorbike, Cycle, Lorry, Truck, Bus etc)
Car > (normal car, sports car, SUV, powered-car)
Cycle > (normal bike, sports bike, kids bike, 3-wheel bike)
-----
Object
- Attributes - cherectristic, properties, fields, data,
- Methods - capabilities, function, action,
(block of code which is used repeatly)
Eg: method fight in a game programming
Eg: Car

Car = object (racing game)
Properties - color, model, make, weight, height, number of door etc like year
Action - start, brake, accelerate, turn, move, reverse, horn

Dog = object
Attributes: color, breed, height, size, etc
Methods: run, bite, bark, sense, smell etc
--------------
Animal > parent class
- function: run(), eat(), sleep())
- properties: age, color, weight

Cat > child class   - run, eat, sleep, snores
                    - age, color, weight, shape

Dog > child class   - run, eat, sleep, barks, bite
                    - age, color, weight, breed

Horse > child       - run, eat, sleep, jumps, seat
                    - age, color, weight, cost

--------------------------------------------------------
Polimorphism
an object which can take many forms

function + > adding

= 2 + 2
= 2 + 3 + 4
= 2+3+4+6
---------------------------------------------------------
Abstraction > when the mechanism is not clear or unknown but the function or capability is required or needed

vehicle > start (code), move (programming), stop (logic development), brake
car > start, move, stop(), brake()
---------------------------------------------------------
Encapsulition - to hide information, to encapsule data

banking system - account number, pin code, password
encapsulate(password)
encapsulate(pin)

balance
add
minus
