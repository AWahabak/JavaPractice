Branching Statements (break, continue, return)
While working with loops, sometimes you might want to skip some statements or terminate the loop.
In such cases, break and continue statements are used.

break;
-> terminates a for, while, or do-while loop and switch statments
----------------------------------------
continue;
--> Directly go at the next iteration of a for, while or do-while loop
After the continue statement, the program moves to the end of the loop. And, test expression is evaluated
(update statement is evaluated in case of the for loop).

The continue statement is almost always used in decision-making statements
------------------------------------
return;
When a method have return type, the result is returned through return keyword
